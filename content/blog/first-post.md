wow! first post! i dont know if i should type in proper grammar so im just gonna go ahead and not, at least for now. maybe proper grammar is reserved only for certain kinds of posts? like, educational type writeups? and casual posts can be written casually? works for me i guess! idk, this is the first post so we'll see how im feeling next time i write something

ANYWAY. this is the first post for my new blog. im planning to do longer, perhaps less casual? writeups on certain features of the blog. like :::tooltips:::tooltips are the thing youre looking at right now, where you mouse over text and it shows you some more text:::, as well as my experience getting better at :::css:::something i kinda suck at:::, and also my biggest vue project yet. ive used vue before, but it was on pretty small things. im coming from react and i can say i definitely prefer vue. theres a reason my previous react-based website never got updated:::...:::to be fair i did make other miscellaneous projects in react but they were often left unfinished, and never made public-facing:::
